Other:
  validator.py:
   ✔ Create funcs for leq, eq and so on instead of notNegative @done (20-11-08 13:31)

  db.py:
   ☐ FIX: the bug about encoding in FileDS.read L102 @critical
   ☐ Finish ProductNormalizer @high
   ☐ FIX: Field set None value in DB L121 @low
   ☐ Check that all getters and setters are written @low
   ☐ Write tests @high
    You'd better write them and only then code
   ☐ Probably spread classes from this file into a few more @high
    It becomes hard to find something here
   ☐ Check all the typehints for an appropriate look @low
  ☐ Create a lib for autocreating getters and setters @low
   Successfully failed. setattr and getattr doesn't work as I thought. I'd better not touch this at all
